# Extra Features

We have other features that are turned off by default and require setting an environment variable to enable:

## Environment and Deploy Group managing

Enable by setting DEPLOY_GROUP_FEATURE=1

Now you will see extra items in the Admin menu:
* Admin -> Environments
** This page allows you to create your deploy environments like 'Production', 'Staging', 'Master', etc...
* Admin -> Deploy Groups
** This allows you to model the individual target hosts/groups within the above environments.

When you set those up, you can now edit the Stages within the Projects and tag the appropriate deploy-groups that those 
stages deploy to.

Now you can use $DEPLOY_GROUPS within the stage commands to target the deploy-groups you've checked the boxes for.
E.g., in the stage commands you can execute: 'echo "Deploying to $DEPLOY_GROUPS"'

Also you get another main menu item 'Environments'. Navigating to there will show you which versions for your projects are 
currently deployed to for the various environments and deploy-groups you configured.

## Auto JIRA issue key detection

Enable by setting JIRA_BASE_URL to a default JIRA instance e.g., `JIRA_BASE_URL=http://jira.example.com/browse/`

This would enable the auto-detection of JIRA issue keys (e.g., KEY-123, SAMSON-456) in the titles and bodies of the pull requests associated with a deploy. The auto-detected JIRA issues will be displayed and linked in the "JIRA Issues" tab of a deploy.

Full absolute JIRA URLs will still be detected when JIRA_BASE_URL is set, and they will take precedence over generated ones (i.e., if JIRA_BASE_URL is https://a.atlassian.net/browse/ and both "KEY-123" and "http://z.atlassian.net/browse/KEY-123" appear in a pull request's title and body, only "http://z.atlassian.net/browse/KEY-123" would appear in the "JIRA Issues" tab). Use full URLs if you need to reference issues of non-default JIRA instances.

## Request additional access rights via email

Add a link to the "You are not authorized..." popup which the user can click to request additional access rights.

The link will also be available on the user's profile page.

<img src="/docs/images/request_access_profile.png?raw=true" width="600" />

The access request requires a manager email and a reason for the additional access rights.

The recipients and subject prefix of the email are configurable, use REQUEST_ACCESS_EMAIL_ADDRESS_LIST and REQUEST_ACCESS_EMAIL_PREFIX environment variables to tweak the message.

The receiving end can be a Samson admin distribution list, a JIRA email trigger which will automatically set up an access ticket, or whatever you fancy.

The feature is enabled by setting REQUEST_ACCESS_FEATURE=1
