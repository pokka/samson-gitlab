To start creating your plugin, navigate to the 'samson_plugin.rb' file
in the new plugin directory above and register for the various hooks
to add views/assets/models to Samson.

This plugin acts mostly like a Rails Engine, so it can contain controllers/
models/routes/migrations/etc...

Amend core models by defining app/decorators/{model}_decorator.rb, it
will be auto-loaded when the underlying model is loaded.

Remember to run 'bundle install' now to get it loaded into Samson for testing!


Happy Coding!
